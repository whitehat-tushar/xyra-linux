# Xyra Linux 0.1 (Alpha)

Xyra is an opinionated Linux desktop experiment focused on stability, predictable UI behavior, reliable audio, and clear onboarding.

It targets desktop users who want Linux to feel *finished* rather than endlessly configurable.

Xyra prioritizes **defaults, constraints, and integration** over flexibility and bleeding-edge features.

## Philosophy

Most Linux desktops optimize for choice.
Xyra optimizes for **consistency**.

The goal is not to expose every knob, but to make everyday desktop usage calm, reliable, and boring in the best possible way.

If something is present, it should:
- work by default
- behave predictably
- not require user tuning

---

## Base

- Base system: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Architecture: amd64
- Desktop focus: single, stable desktop configuration
- Target audience: desktop users, learners, and portfolio reviewers
